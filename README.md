# `co` Example
This repo is some files I'm using for a basic explanation of how <a href="https://github.com/tj/co">`co`</a> works

It's a basic, promises-only implementation of `co` and some examples which are runnable in node.

##Intended reading order:

1. `generators.js`
2. `no-co-async.js`
3. `co-async.js`
4. `homebrew-co.js`

##Supplemental:
* `homebrew-co-fs.js`
